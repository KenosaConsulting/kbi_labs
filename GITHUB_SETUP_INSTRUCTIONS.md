# 🚀 GitHub Setup Instructions for KBI Labs

## Your code is ready to push! Here's how to complete the GitHub setup:

### Option 1: Push to Existing Repository
If you already have a GitHub repository URL:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL

# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Create New Repository
1. **Go to GitHub.com** and create a new repository
2. **Repository name**: `KBILabs` (or your preferred name)
3. **Keep it public or private** (your choice)
4. **DON'T initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Copy the repository URL** from the quick setup section

Then run:
```bash
# Add the new repository as remote
git remote add origin YOUR_NEW_REPO_URL

# Push to main branch  
git push -u origin main
```
