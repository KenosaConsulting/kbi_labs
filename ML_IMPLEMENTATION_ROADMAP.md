- [ ] Set up experiment tracking (MLflow integration)

**Code Integration Points:**
```python
# Extend existing enrichment pipeline
from ml_procurement_intelligence_design import AutomatedFeatureEngineering

# Add to existing workflow
async def enhanced_company_enrichment(company_data):
    # Existing KBI Labs enrichment
    enriched = await unified_enricher.enrich_company_comprehensive(company_data)
    
    # Add ML features
    feature_engineer = AutomatedFeatureEngineering()
    ml_features = feature_engineer.generate_temporal_features(pd.DataFrame([enriched]))
    
    return {**enriched, **ml_features.iloc[0].to_dict()}
```

### **Phase 2: Core ML Models (Weeks 5-8) - "Predictive Intelligence"**

#### Week 5-6: Automated Feature Engineering (TPOT Integration)
**Novel Implementation:**
- Leverage TPOT for automated ML pipeline optimization
- Domain-specific feature engineering for government contracting
- Integrate with existing procurement APIs for feature generation

**Key Features:**
```python
# Automated model discovery for contract success prediction
contract_success_model = TPOTClassifier(
    generations=10, population_size=50,
    cv=5, random_state=42,
    config_dict=procurement_optimized_config
)

# Features: Current KBI scores + new temporal/network features
features = [
    'procurement_intelligence_score',  # Existing
    'contract_frequency',  # New temporal
    'network_centrality',  # New network
    'market_concentration_hhi'  # New competitive
]
```

#### Week 7-8: Contract Success Prediction Models
**Objective**: Predict probability of winning specific contracts

**Models to Implement:**
1. **Binary Classification**: Will company win this contract?
2. **Multi-class Classification**: Which companies will win in this NAICS?
3. **Regression**: Expected contract value for company
4. **Time-to-Award Prediction**: When will contract be awarded?

**Training Data Sources:**
- Historical USASpending awards (your existing data)
- Current SAM.gov opportunities (your new API)
- Company characteristics (your enrichment pipeline)

### **Phase 3: Graph Intelligence (Weeks 9-12) - "Network Insights"**

#### Week 9-10: Procurement Graph Construction
**Revolutionary Approach**: Multi-layer heterogeneous graph
- **Nodes**: Companies, Contracts, Agencies, Opportunities, NAICS codes
- **Edges**: Awards, Bids, Partnerships, Geographic proximity
- **Features**: Your existing enrichment data as node attributes

```python
# Example graph structure
G = nx.MultiDiGraph()

# Company nodes with KBI Labs features  
G.add_node("company_123", 
          procurement_score=85,
          gsa_rates_count=12,
          fpds_performance=78)

# Contract relationships with award details
G.add_edge("company_123", "contract_abc", 
          relationship="awarded",
          value=500000,
          performance_rating=4.2)
```

3. **Fraud Detection**: Unusual network patterns and relationships
4. **Market Intelligence**: Hidden supplier ecosystems discovery

**GNN Architecture:**
```python
class ProcurementGNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, hidden_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = GATConv(num_features, hidden_dim, heads=4)
        self.conv2 = GATConv(hidden_dim * 4, hidden_dim)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 2)  # Success/failure
    
    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        return self.classifier(x)
```

### **Phase 4: Advanced Analytics (Weeks 13-16) - "Intelligent Insights"**

async def predict_contract_success(company_uei: str, opportunity_id: str):
    # Use trained models for prediction
    prediction = await ml_models.predict_success(company_uei, opportunity_id)
    return {"success_probability": prediction, "confidence": confidence}

@app.get("/api/v1/ml/anomalies")
async def get_procurement_anomalies(filters: AnomalyFilters):
    # Return detected anomalies with explanations
    return await anomaly_detector.get_recent_anomalies(filters)

@app.get("/api/v1/ml/market-forecast/{naics_code}")
async def get_market_forecast(naics_code: str, months_ahead: int = 6):
